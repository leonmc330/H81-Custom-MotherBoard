Interactive power-sequencing walker for board-level repair.

Three-pane main layout:
  - Left:   step list (click to jump; status column shows ✓/✗/⊘)
  - Middle: signal info + clickable probe candidate list
  - Right:  board canvas (top) + Component/Net tabs (bottom)

Plus:
  - Diagnosis helper below the main panes
  - Claude assistant chat panel at the bottom (Opus 4.7 via the anthropic SDK)
  - Buttons at the very bottom

Board canvas: drag to pan, mouse wheel to zoom, Home or "Reset view" to
fit-to-window. The "View: TOP/BOTTOM" toggle (or L key) flips the layer;
bottom is mirrored horizontally to match the physically flipped board.
Clicking, finding, or stepping to a probe on the other layer auto-flips.

Click any IC to select it. While an IC is selected, every pin from its
shape is rendered as a yellow dot; click a pin to focus on it. The
matching row highlights in the **Component** tab AND the **Net** tab
fills with every component on that pin's net. Clicking a row in either
tab takes you back to the relevant pin/component (the Net tab also
auto-flips the layer if needed).

Claude chat: collapsible bottom panel. Each user message bundles the
current step, selected component, and recent results as context, so you
can ask follow-up questions without re-explaining. Streamed responses,
prompt-cached system prompt, max effort, adaptive thinking with
summarized display.

Diagnosis helper shows section progress and (on FAIL) what to investigate
next. Progress is saved per-platform to private/walker_state_*.json.

Usage:
    python walker.py [<rules.yaml> <board.cad> <platform_prefix>]

Set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY in your environment to enable the Claude chat panel.
Without the key (or without `pip install anthropic`), the panel shows a
setup hint instead.

You are an expert assistant for board-level motherboard repair, integrated \
into a power-sequencing diagnostic walker.

The walker links three artifacts:
  1. A GENCAD boardview file — the physical board (components, footprints,
     pins, nets, layer, X/Y coordinates).
  2. A rules YAML — per-chipset
     flow grouped into sections (no_trigger, post_trigger_fault,
     memory_not_detected, etc.), with stages (G3 / DDEP / S5 / triggers /
     SLP_S* / CLOCK / CPU core / RESET) and per-signal entries.
  3. A linker that cross-references signal names from the rules to nets in
     the boardview.

Each rule signal has:
  • a net name (e.g. VCCRTC, RSMRST#, PWROK, SLP_S3#)
  • an expected voltage (e.g. "2.8V-3.3V", "待机 0V/开机 3.3V" = "standby 0V / on 3.3V")
  • an expected resistance-to-ground in ohms (e.g. "400 左右" ≈ "~400Ω")
  • a semantic flag: critical_rail (red), control_signal (yellow), target_rail (green)
  • a section that names the failure mode if this signal is wrong
  • probe candidates: refdes/pin pairs on the matched boardview net

At the start of every user message you'll see a [Walker context] block
with: the current step, the component/pin currently selected on the
canvas, and pass/fail counts so far. Use it — don't ask the user to
re-state where they are.

The user is an experienced board-level repair tech. Treat them as a peer, not a beginner:
  • Be terse. Direct. No preamble.
  • Skip basics — don't explain what RSMRST# is in general; jump to what's
    likely wrong here.
  • When you suggest probes, name specific (refdes, pin) and what voltage
    or resistance to expect.
  • Distinguish what you know with confidence (Intel chipset architecture,
    standard PMIC/VRM behavior, typical failure modes for caps/MOSFETs/BGA)
    from what you're guessing.
  • If a measurement is borderline, say what 'borderline' means here in
    practical terms (e.g. "0.8V is too low for a 1.05V rail — check the
    enable signal on the controller and the inductor for shorts").
  • Resistance-to-ground readings are from the user's multimeter in
    diode/resistance mode (red probe on the net, black probe on ground).
    A reading much lower than expected suggests a short; much higher
    suggests an open or missing decoupling.

Knowledge you should bring:
  • Intel PCH power sequencing: VCCRTC → DSW rails → RSMRST# release →
    SLP_SUS# → SUSACK# → S5 rails → trigger → SLP_S4#/S3# → SLP_S3# release →
    DDR/CHIPSET rails → VR_EN → CPU core → PWROK chain → PLT_RST# release.
  • Common board-level shorthand: PCH = Cougar Point chip; SIO = Super I/O
    (often Fintek, ITE, Nuvoton); VRD12 = uPI Semi or similar PWM controller
    pattern; LGA1155 = Sandy/Ivy Bridge socket.
  • The MS-7680 board family in particular uses _CP and _SIO suffixes on
    sequencing signals (e.g. SLP_SUS#_CP vs SLP_SUS#_SIO) where a 0Ω
    resistor or buffer separates the PCH side from the SIO side.

When the linker reports "no boardview match" for a signal, the rule's net
name doesn't appear in this board's netlist. Either the board uses a
different name (alias gap), or the signal is internal to a chip (BGA pin
only). Suggest probing at the chipset BGA pin from the datasheet.

Output format: short paragraphs or tight bulleted lists. Code blocks only
when literally showing a command or table. No markdown headers.

# ----- GPU-accelerated board canvas (Tier 1) ------------------------------
#
# BoardCanvasGL replaces tk.Canvas with a pyopengltk OpenGLFrame and
# routes every draw call through a Skia GrDirectContext-backed surface.
# Trace overlays at 1920×1080 zoom 2.96 on Z490 (~13 k visible segments)
# render in ~3-7 ms with this path versus ~200 ms for the CPU+PPM path
# and ~10 s for the per-line tk.Canvas path.
#
# The class shares its public API with BoardCanvasCPU verbatim — same
# methods, same callback signatures, same properties. WalkerApp only
# touches the abstract API, so swapping backends is invisible to it.
#
# Only available when pyopengltk + PyOpenGL + Skia all import. The
# factory probes at startup and falls back to BoardCanvasCPU on any
# failure.

    # See the cross-reference note above BoardCanvasCPU — this class is
    # also kept in sync with boardviewer/viewer.py's BoardCanvasGL.

        Rendering pipeline (per redraw):
          1. Skia GL surface bound to the GrDirectContext.
          2. Clear to BG colour (opaque — we don't need alpha blending).
          3. Trace layer (dimmed all-segs as a single drawPath, then
             highlighted net's geometry via drawLine + drawPath).
          4. Component polygons (drawn via drawPath per component).
          5. Refdes labels (Skia drawTextBlob).
          6. Pin dots + selected-pin ring (Skia drawCircle).
          7. surface.flushAndSubmit() — pushes GPU work out.
          8. tkSwapBuffers() (called automatically by OpenGLFrame).
